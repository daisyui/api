faq:
  - Q: Can I use this template without Lemon Squeezy or Gumroad?
    A:
      If the Lemon Squeezy API key or Gumroad API key is not provided, the data will come from the local JSON file. So you
      can use the template without Lemon Squeezy or Gumroad, using a static JSON file, and for checkout and payment you
      can use your own solution.
